### Problem
1. Weighing food and referring to a list of carb count is accurate but slow

2. Diet-tracking apps are untailored for T1D as it's full of unnecessary information

3. Features that estimate carbs with a picture is hidden behind a paywall

### Solution
With our mobile app, T1D patients can simply take a picture and quickly obtain a carbs count. Our app features portion estimation (depth map) and food classification algorithms (ResNet50, convolutional neural network) that can calculate carbs count within seconds, and a simple UI that allows you to log your food with <10 interactions
